### ***Project 1 Feedback***

**Overall:** Good work! Your answers are on point!

**Some notes**
* ***Part 1 - Q.1:*** Your answer is definitely correct, but one thing to always keep in mind when approaching new data is to discover, and then handle, missing values. We will work on this more in the next homework.

**Something to think about:**
    We don't touch on it too much in class, but think about how you can apply statistical tests to your data. There are many handy tests to determine difference of means (very useful), tests to determine assumptions of an underlying distribution, etc.

***Note: if you ever feel a topic is too elementary, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings and I can send things your way (especially once we get into modeling!)***
